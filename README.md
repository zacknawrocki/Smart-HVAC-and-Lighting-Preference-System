## HVAC & Lighting Preference System

**HVAC preference manager for the Smart Conference Room (SCR) in CII 7003**

This repository contains portions of the public code used to run the Smart Conference Room's (our research testbed's) system for collecting and implementing user preferences at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

This repository contains code for the coordinating server and the preference client.

Currently, the coordinating server is an AWS EC2 instance and the preference clients are Raspberry Pi model 3s with touch screen displays.

* **coordinator**: directory containing preference coordinator server code and other coordinator files
* **preference-client**: directory containing preference client code and other preference client files
